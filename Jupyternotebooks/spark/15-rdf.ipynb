    "The Resource Description Framework is an infrastructure that enables the encoding, exchange and reuse of structured metadata. A common variant for knowledge bases is a triple store in which atomic facts are stored. Every record is structured as `<subject> <predicate> <value>`, where the  predicate describes the relation between the `subject` and the `value`. The `subject` is usually an identifier for an entity (e.g. movie, person, event) and the value can be either a literal value (e.g. String, int) or also an identfier for an entity. The predicates and identifier are described in ontologies, providing a standard for semantics and to facilitate combining knowledge over different bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.wikidata.org is one of the many projects that collects and stores knowledge in the world in a publicly available knowledge base. You can search the site for entities, and browse the facts stored (e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83495 for movie The Matrix). In the entity browser identifiers are displayed with their text label, and linked to the identifiers' page."

For instance, wdt:P31 is the predicate 'instance of' and wd:Q11424 is the identifier for the Film-class. Thus the first rule matches all identifiers ?movieid that occur in a tripe ?movieid 'instance of' Film, or all movie identifiers. (You can easily find identifiers for predicates and values by browsing to a entity page (e.g. page for The Matrix above) and looking at the popups of the predicates).\n",
